# Machine-Learing-COVID-19-Outcome-Prediction-Death-Recovered-
The data used in this project will help to identify whether a person is going to recover from coronavirus ymptoms or not based on some pre-defined standard symptoms. 
These symptoms are based on guidelines given by the World Health Organization.  
1. Performed Preprocessing for the data 
2. Performed data analysis 
3. Applied various machine learing classifiers and compared between their outputs 
4. Visualizing the data. 
5. Reached high level of accuracy with almost no overfitting

The Project includes 
1. **K-Nearest-Neighbour Classifier:**

     With One-Hot-Encoding, With Normalization, Applying both Normalization and One-Hot-Encoding
    finally comparing between the 3 models with respect to F2

2. **Naïve Bayes Classifier:**

     Without Hyperparamter Tuning, With Hyperparameter Tuning, Comparison between the 2 models with respect to F2

*Implementation of Naïve Bayes, it a basic implementation of the naive bayes.*

3.**Logistic Regression Classifier:**

 Without Hyperparameters Tuning, With Hyperparameter Tuning and One-Hot-Encoding, then a Comparison between the 3 models with respect to F2

4. **Decision Tree Classifier:**

Without Hyperprameter tuning, With Hyperparamter tuning
